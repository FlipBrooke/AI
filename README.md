# AI
Contains work for a 2024-2025 Artificial Intelligence class.

While I'm not directly copying code generated by AI, part of this course involves debugging and programming assistance using AI tools, primarily ChatGPT-4. As a result, some code or programming methods in this repository may reflect AI-influenced approaches. I know very little about python at this point, so formatting relies heavily on AI.

Any data or placeholder data may be AI generated or gained from publicly available sources. These resources are used for educational use only, and I claim no ownership over them.
